Upgrading and downgrading
==========================

How to Upgrade
--------------

If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely
shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the
installer (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/Unobtanium-Qt (on Mac) or
unobtaniumd/unobtanium-qt (on Linux).

If you are upgrading from version 0.10.5.0 or earlier, the first time you run
0.11.0.0-alpha your blockchain files will be re-indexed, which will take anywhere from
30 minutes to several hours, depending on the speed of your machine.

Downgrading warnings
--------------------

There are currently no downgrade complications reported so far, if so found this part of the release notes will be updated.

Detailed release notes follow. This overview includes changes that affect behavior, not code moves, refactors and string updates. For convenience in locating the code changes and accompanying discussion, both the pull request and git merge commit are mentioned.

0.11.0.0-alpha Release notes * Strict Semantic Versioning to follow hereafter.
